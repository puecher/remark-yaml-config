# remark-yaml-config [![Build Status][build-badge]][build-status] [![Coverage Status][coverage-badge]][coverage-status] [![Chat][chat-badge]][chat]

Configure [**remark**][remark] with YAML front-matter.  This requires
[`remark-frontmatter`][remark-frontmatter] as well.

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install remark-yaml-config
```

## Usage

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
---
remark:
  commonmark: true
  bullet: "*"
---

1)  Commonmark list (this is a parse setting)

*   Hello (this is a stringify setting)
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```javascript
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var remark = require('remark')
var frontmatter = require('remark-frontmatter')
var yamlConfig = require('remark-yaml-config')

remark()
  .use(frontmatter)
  .use(yamlConfig)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
---
remark:
  commonmark: true
  bullet: "*"
---

1.  Commonmark list (this is a parse setting)

*   Hello (this is a stringify setting)
```

## API

### `remark.use(yamlConfig)`

Passes the configuration at the `remark` field as [parse][parse-settings]
and [stringify][stringify-settings] settings to **remark**.

Just like [`remark-comment-config`][remark-comment-config], but YAML is
more visible.
